# MyMacroKeyboardKeyCode

#First of all, if you ask the question why does it open the spootlight and turn it on from there. I could not run it with the .bat format as in windows.

#I tried running it using the terminal but there was not much difference in seconds. as a result, he wrote the string again and ran it. That's why I'm using it this way, I'm going to format it according to the language I use and start using it. I'm trying to create the most suitable shortcuts for myself, since it's in the testing phase right now, I'll update it as I edit.
